## Introduction

- A common financial prediction done by businesses is analyzing their
  customerâ€™s lifetime value. This calculation takes a look at the buyer's
  purchasing history and formulates the potential revenue customers can bring
  in the long term.

- In this sample I share how to automate to use a
  [custom function](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions)
  in the Google Sheet's Apps Script editor.

- This personalized formula saves you time from having to perform multiple
  operations customer data by hand.

- The function analyzes the length of time a customer has been with you,
  takes an average of their buying history, and compares it to your entire
  customer buyer history. The logic of your custom function is called into your
  spreadsheet like a formula ex: =LIFETIME_VALUES(A2:C).
